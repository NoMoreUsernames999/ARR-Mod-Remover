# ARR Mod Remover
 A tool for Minecraft pack devs that automatically removes Curseforge ARR mods (which don't give redist permissions) that are designated in the txt file. This ensures your pack is OK to upload to Modrinth. The removed mods can then be added to File Director to download directly from the mod's Curse page on pack launch. 

## How to use
1. Download both the txt and bat file
2. Drag both into your mods folder of the server pack
3. Run the bat file
4. Drag both files out before uploading your server pack
5. Copy the terminal output, and then use the names listed to set up File Director for those mods  

## How to contribute
